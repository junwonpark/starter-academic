abstract: "Past research has established a relationship between awe and
  explanatory frameworks, such as religion. We extend this work, showing (a) the
  effects of awe on a separate source of explanation: attitudes toward science,
  and (b) how the effects of awe on attitudes toward scientific explanations
  depend on individual differences in theism. Across 3 studies, we find
  consistent support that awe decreases the perceived explanatory power of
  science for the theistic (Study 1 and 2) and mixed support that awe affects
  attitudes toward scientific explanations for the nontheistic (Study 3)."
