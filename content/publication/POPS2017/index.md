abstract: "By some accounts, global economic inequality is at its highest point
  on record. The pernicious effects of this broad societal trend are striking:
  Rising inequality is linked to poorer health and well-being across countries,
  continents, and cultures. The economic and psychological forces that
  perpetuate inequality continue to be studied, and in this theoretical review,
  we examine the role of daily experiences of economic inequality—the
  communication of social class signals between interaction partners—in this
  process. We theorize that social class signals activate social comparison
  processes that strengthen group boundaries between the haves and have nots in
  society. In particular, we argue that class signals are a frequent, rapid, and
  accurate component of person perception, and we provide new data and analyses
  demonstrating the accuracy of class signaling in 60-s interactions, Facebook
  photographs, and isolated recordings of brief speech. We suggest that barriers
  to the reduction of economic inequality in society arise directly from this
  class signaling process through the augmentation of class boundaries and the
  elicitation of beliefs and behaviors that favor the economic status quo."
