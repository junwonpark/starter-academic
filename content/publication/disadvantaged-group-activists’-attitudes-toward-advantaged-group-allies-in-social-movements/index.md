abstract: Allyship is a growing phenomenon in many organizational contexts, and
  the involvement of advantaged group allies in identity-oriented social
  movements (e.g., men in the feminist movement) is ubiquitous. However, the
  impression that these advantaged group allies make on their intended
  beneficiaries is unclear. Over the course of four studies, we explore
  disadvantaged group activists’ attitudes toward their advantaged group allies.
  We find converging evidence that disadvantaged group activists prefer
  advantaged group allies who engage in actions that demonstrate high levels of
  trustworthiness (e.g., selflessness, loyalty) and low levels of influence
  (e.g., centrality, power) in the movement, whereas non-activists show only a
  significant preference on the influence dimension. This evidence was observed
  in a survey of 117 social movement activists (Study 1), and in three
  experiments with 752 liberal women and nonbinary individuals (Study 2), 305
  feminist social movement activists (Study 3), and a separate sample of 805
  feminist social movement activists (Study 4). Taken together, our research
  documents the causal effects that different allyship behaviors have on
  beneficiaries’ attitudes toward advantaged group allies (Studies 2, 3, & 4)
  while recruiting samples of currently engaged movement activists to solicit
  their unique perspectives (Studies 1, 3, & 4). We thereby identify the
  specific ways of being an advantaged group ally that elicit the most positive
  impressions from their intended beneficiaries, which have direct implications
  for supporting intergroup coalitions and social change.
