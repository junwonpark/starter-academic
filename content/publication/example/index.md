abstract: Economic inequality is at its highest point on record and is linked to
  poorer health and well-being across countries. The forces that perpetuate
  inequality continue to be studied, and here we examine how a personâ€™s position
  within the economic hierarchy, their social class, is accurately perceived and
  reproduced by mundane patterns embedded in brief speech. Studies 1 through 4
  examined the extent that people accurately perceive social class based on
  brief speech patterns. We find that brief speech spoken out of context is
  sufficient to allow respondents to discern the social class of speakers at
  levels above chance accuracy, that adherence to both digital and subjective
  standards for English is associated with higher perceived and actual social
  class of speakers, and that pronunciation cues in speech communicate social
  class over and above speech content. In study 5, we find that people with
  prior hiring experience use speech patterns in preinterview conversations to
  judge the fit, competence, starting salary, and signing bonus of prospective
  job candidates in ways that bias the process in favor of applicants of higher
  social class. Overall, this research provides evidence for the stratification
  of common speech and its role in both shaping perceiver judgments and
  perpetuating inequality during the briefest interactions.
