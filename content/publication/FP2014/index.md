abstract: Social class ranks people on the social ladder of society, and in this
  research we examine how perceptions of economic standing shape the way that
  individuals evaluate the self. Given that reminders of one’s own subordinate
  status in society are an indicator of how society values the self in
  comparison to others, we predicted that chronic lower perceptions of economic
  standing rank vis-à-vis others would explain associations between objective
  social class and negative self-evaluation, whereas situation-specific
  reminders of low economic standing would elicit negative self-evaluations,
  particularly in those from lower-class backgrounds. In Study 1, perceptions of
  social class rank accounted for the positive relationship between objective
  material resource measures of social class and self-esteem. In Study 2,
  lower-class individuals who received a low (versus equal) share of economic
  resources in an economic game scenario reported more negative self-conscious
  emotions relative to upper-class individuals. Discussion focused on the
  implications of this research for understanding class-based cultural models of
  the self, and for how social class shapes self-evaluations chronically.
