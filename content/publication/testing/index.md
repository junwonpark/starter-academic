abstract: Individual agency accounts of social class persist in society and even
  in psychological science despite clear evidence for the role of social
  structures. This article argues that social class is defined by the structural
  dynamics of society. Specifically, access to powerful networks, groups, and
  institutions, and inequalities in wealth and other economic resources shape
  proximal social environments that influence how individuals express their
  internal states and motivations. An account of social class that highlights
  the means by which structures shape and are shaped by individuals guides our
  understanding of how people move up or down in the social class hierarchy, and
  provides a framework for interpreting neuroscience studies, experimental
  paradigms, and approaches that attempt to intervene on social class
  disparities.
