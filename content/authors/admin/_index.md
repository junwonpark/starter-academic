I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and Department of Psychology, having completed my PhD in Organizational Behavior at the Yale School of Management. While at Yale, I was a member of the [Contending with Societal Inequality Lab](https://www.csinequality.com/) under the mentorship of [Michael W. Kraus](http://www.michaelwkraus.com/) and [Cydney H. Dupree](https://cydneydupree.com/).

My research examines the individual and structural dynamics that undergird the relationship between social positions and social inequality in the context of economic, gender, and racial inequality. I examine how people challenge or reinforce societal inequities while occupying different social positions.
