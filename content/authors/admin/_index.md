I am currently a research scientist at Amazon in the People eXperience and Technology Central Science (PXTCS) Team focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion research. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and Department of Psychology, having completed my PhD in Organizational Behavior at the Yale School of Management.
