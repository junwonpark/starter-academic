I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and Department of Psychology, having completed my PhD in Organizational Behavior at the Yale School of Management. While at Yale, I was a member of the [Contending with Societal Inequality Lab](https://www.csinequality.com/), under the mentorship of [Michael W. Kraus](http://www.michaelwkraus.com/) and [Cydney H. Dupree](https://cydneydupree.com/), and a Policy Fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies.

I am interested in studying the individual and structural dynamics that undergird the relationship between social positions and social inequality. In particular, my research examines how people challenge or reinforce societal inequities while occupying disparate social positions in the context of economic, gender, and racial inequality.

In addition to my research, I am also committed to advancing equitable access to higher education for members of marginalized groups, having served as a Diversity Fellow at Yale's Office for Graduate Student Development & Diversity. Being undocumented myself, I specialize in supporting undocumented students in higher education, which you can learn more about here.
